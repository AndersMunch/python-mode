* In case `Pymacs' was installed via `make' on your system, don't
  activate inlined one.  Keep `py-load-pymacs-p' nil.

  Otherwise setting `py-load-pymacs-p' to `t' should enable a
  company-based auto-completion - alongside with
  `py-company-pycomplete-p'.

* Troubeshooting
  On systems which run Python3 as default
  setting
  export PYMACS_PYTHON=python2
  was reported being useful.
  Newer Pymacs should not need this.
  
* Bug reports
  Should python-mode fail or a feature is missed, please open a ticket in Issues. If possible, give a description starting from `emacs -Q'.
  Also output of M-x report-emacs-bug RET might be useful. Add the version of python-mode - M-x py-version RET.

  If you can, please check against current trunk or development branch.
